Personal piggy bank enforced by smart contracts

According to a number of studies done in the 1960s and 1970s, called the "Stanford Marshmallow Experiment", patient children that could delay a reward, such as a marshmallow, in order to receive a larger award, such as more marshmallows, seem to have better life outcomes later in their lives. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment  This behaviour is referred to as "delayed gratification". 

Moving on, it is very difficult to save money in the modern world, given how immersed we are with so many new products and services popping up and an endless number of ways to spend money. The common wisdom is to save 10% of your income, but this is easier said than done when you can spend money so easily. No matter how diligent you are at saving, or investing, there is nothing to stop you from spending your savings or selling your investments before you reach your goals. 

As a child I was told that the purpose of a "piggy bank" or a "money box" of some kind is to force you to save your money as there would be no point "breaking" the enclosure until it was actually full. In theory, a piggy bank is an "enforcer" of delayed gratification. However, in reality whether you are holding your funds in the bank, under the pillow, or a vault, there is nothing to stop you from breaking in and taking out your own money. 

This is where blockchain can help. People in the community have already built "time locked wallets", where a smart contract holds your funds until a certain date is reached, at which time it releases it back to the address of the sender. A public blockchain such as Ethereum allows someone to create a piggy bank that enforces the rules you set upon it. A smart contract can reliably enforce "delayed gratification" upon the creator. Using blockchain you can force yourself to save your money, or hold your investments until a certain date, even if you lack the will power, or are an impulsive person. 

Using Ethereum, one can hold anything from an investment token to a stablecoin within a smart contract. You could setup a weekly savings plan and put 1 DAI, equal to a dollar, in a smart contract and this would force you to save money until a certain date. 

Programmable money allows you to create untouchable money that is safe from even you, the owner. This project will be dedicated to building enforced piggy banks on Ethereum.
